If you dont understand the context scan the project for you to get an understanding, you can also check for the planning_with_files and the findings,progress,and task_plan containts information the can be cruicial for initial understanding, when doing a task I wanted you to always research before doing the task, ask clarification questions, use context7 and research, use the skill located in the .agent/skills/planning-with-file/SKILL.md to start the task, i wanted you to create the clarification question in the folder planning-with-files/<current-task>, <current-task> the current task is the task that I instructured you in my prompt,I wanted you to put the summary of the things you have created there like from task,findings,progress, the findings,progress,task_plan should still be existed in the planning_with_files/ before starting the execution of the task ask a go signal for me to continue and tell me that you created clarifying questions in the <current-task> folder, before finishing the task make sure to test if its working like compiling it,also always udpate documentation and provide a guide for me what are the changes in code and functionality, if you think the current task is not yet finished like this is part of the current task and your just improving or fixing things for the current task dont create another task, if you think you are done with the current task create another task and do all those things again, if you you already get a go signal to start implementing but another set of questions arose you can continue asking question, if you think the current task is related to the previous task instead of creating another task just refer to that one and just add update like improving or fixing this current task, or changing etc, i wanted you to always observe the project coding patterns and follow them, if you think the current prompt requires multiple task then create multiple task base on the user prompt, also this is something that you shouuld never forget always and always commit before finishing your current actions like in all parts of the process wherein you stop you should commit first your commit should also be proper like ignore the thigns to ignore etc.
